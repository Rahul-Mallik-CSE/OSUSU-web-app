    question: "How do Osusu groups work?",
    answer:

    question: "Can I join more than one group?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can join multiple groups simultaneously. This allows you to save at different rates and receive payouts at different times. Just ensure you can meet all contribution commitments for each group you join.",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "What happens if I miss a contribution?",
    answer:
      "Missing a contribution can delay the entire group's cycle. We send reminders before due dates. If you miss a payment, you'll need to catch up quickly. Repeated missed payments may result in removal from the group and affect your ability to join future groups.",
  },
